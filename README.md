# Tool for Fixing Broken Urdu Encoding

Missing characters when you try to change Urdu written in Nashk fonts to a Nastaliq/Nastaleeq font? This small utility converts Arabic unicode characters to their corresponding Urdu unicode, enabling Nastaliq fonts to properly render the text in Urdu.

## Implementation
Text conversion is done 100% client-side by a Vue script rendered in the browser. The website's general architecture is powered by [Astro](https://astro.build/).
